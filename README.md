- Call an API to get users
	- Refer to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
	- Store the data in a redux store
- Make 3 pages
	- A page to display the users from the redux store
	- A page to add a user
	- A page to edit a user
	- A page to clear user redux store
- Add/edit does not require an API. Just update the user redux store accordingly
- Make sure to use Expo to run the app
